`crayons` provides crayon-based color palettes. For nostalgic uses, consider combining with [ggrough](https://github.com/xvrdm/ggrough) or [roughsf](https://github.com/schochastics/roughsf).

## Installation

You can install the development version of crayons from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github('christopherkenny/crayons')
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ggplot2)
library(crayons)

mpg |>
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  scale_color_crayons(palette = 'original')
```
