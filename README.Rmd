`crayons` provides crayon-based color palettes. For nostalgic uses, consider combining with [ggrough](https://github.com/xvrdm/ggrough) or [roughsf](https://github.com/schochastics/roughsf). 

These palettes are not necessarily (and unlikely to be) color-blind friendly. For public-facing work, consider a color-blind friendly package, such as [Cory McCartan's wacolors](https://github.com/corymccartan/wacolors).

## Installation

`crayons` is available on CRAN and can be installed using:

```r
install.packages('crayons')
```

You can also install the development version of crayons from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github('christopherkenny/crayons')
```

## Example

`crayons` provides basic ggplot2 scales for `fill` and `color` (also aliased as `colour`).

```{r example}
library(ggplot2)
library(crayons)

mpg |>
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  scale_color_crayons(palette = 'original')
```

`crayons` has many palettes, based on current and long-gone crayon packs.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
for (i in seq_along(crayons)) {
  p <- plot(crayons[[i]]) +
    ggplot2::labs(title = names(crayons)[[i]])
  print(p)
}
```
