Description: Provides color palettes based on crayon colors since the early 1900s. 
    Colors are based on various crayon colors, sets, and promotional palettes, most of
    which can be found at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors>. All 
    palettes are discrete palettes and are not necessarily color-blind friendly. 
    Provides scales for 'ggplot2' for discrete coloring.
